Avalanche Effect
The Avalanche Effect refers to the fact that for a good cipher, changes in the plaintext affect the ciphertext. The algorithm produces a completely different output for a minimally changed input. For example, the SHA-2 checksum algorithm or the AES encryption algorithm show a strong avalanche effect.

Strict avalanche criterion (SAC)
In the strict avalanche criterion, you look at each bit one by one and you verify that what ever the other bits will change, it will have a 50% probability to switch.
