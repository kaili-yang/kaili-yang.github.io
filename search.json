[{"title":"Single Sign-On (SSO) and Central Authentication Service(CAS)","date":"2023-03-30T06:47:43.000Z","url":"/2023/03/29/Mar202329/","categories":[["undefined",""]],"content":"IntroductionSingle Sign-On (SSO) is a widely used authentication technique that allows users to log in once and access multiple applications without having to enter their credentials repeatedly. It saves time and effort for users and increases security for applications. What is Single Sign-On?Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication mechanism that allows a user to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials. Once the user is authenticated, they do not need to re-enter their credentials to access other applications that support SSO. The user’s identity is verified only once, and the user is granted access to all the authorized applications. Benefits of Single Sign-On Reduced login times: Users no longer need to remember and enter multiple sets of credentials, reducing login times. Improved user experience: SSO simplifies the login process for users, improving their experience. Increased security: With SSO, the user’s credentials are verified only once, reducing the risk of credential theft. Reduced management costs: SSO reduces the number of credentials that need to be managed, simplifying the management process.Token and Credential Tokens and credentials are two important concepts in SSO. A token is a piece of data that represents a user’s identity, and it is used to grant access to an application. A credential is a piece of data that a user provides to prove their identity. In SSO, a user’s credentials are verified once, and a token is issued to represent their identity. This token is then used to grant access to other applications that support SSO. The user’s credentials are never transmitted to other applications, reducing the risk of credential theft. SolutionsThere’re many technologies used for authentication and authorization. CAS (Central Authentication Service): CAS is a single sign-on (SSO) protocol that allows users to authenticate once with a central authentication server and then access multiple applications without having to log in again. CAS uses a ticket-granting server (TGS) to issue tickets to authenticated users, which can be used to access different applications. OAuth (Open Authorization): OAuth is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their login credentials. OAuth uses access tokens to grant access, and users can revoke those tokens at any time. OpenID: OpenID is a decentralized authentication protocol that allows users to authenticate with multiple websites using a single set of login credentials. OpenID relies on the concept of identity providers (IDPs) that can authenticate users and provide their identity information to websites that support OpenID. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): LDAP is a protocol used for accessing and managing directory information, such as user account information. LDAP is often used for authentication and authorization in enterprise environments, where user account information is stored in a directory service such as Active Directory. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): SAML is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, such as identity providers and service providers. SAML allows users to authenticate once with an identity provider and then access multiple service providers without having to log in again. Technology Pros Cons Suitable for CAS Simple to set up and use; supports single sign-on for multiple applications; customizable authentication flow Limited support for modern authentication standards; requires a central authentication server Intranet environments or small-scale deployments OAuth Provides secure and granular authorization controls; supports delegated authorization; widely adopted by modern web applications Can be complex to set up and configure; may require additional security measures to prevent token theft or misuse Web and mobile applications with complex authorization requirements OpenID Supports decentralized authentication; reduces the need for multiple usernames and passwords; customizable authentication flow Limited support for modern authentication standards; may require additional integration efforts with third-party identity providers Websites or applications that require authentication with multiple identity providers LDAP Provides a central directory for user and application information; supports granular access controls; widely used in enterprise environments Can be complex to set up and maintain; may require additional security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches Enterprise environments or organizations with a central directory service SAML Provides secure and standardized authentication and authorization data exchange; supports single sign-on and federated authentication Can be complex to set up and maintain; may require additional integration efforts with third-party identity providers; limited support for modern authentication standards Enterprises or organizations with multiple service providers or identity providers that require federated authentication "},{"title":"Knowledge Cards","date":"2023-03-28T00:45:58.000Z","url":"/2023/03/27/Mar202327/","categories":[["undefined",""]],"content":"Avalanche EffectThe Avalanche Effect refers to the fact that for a good cipher, changes in the plaintext affect the ciphertext.

Don’t give up on your goals for the fear of failure, keep trying. Two scientists consider the origins of discoveries and other innovative behavior Scientific discovery is popularly believed to result from the sheer genius of such intellectual stars as naturalist Charles Darwin and theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Our view of such unique contributions to science often disregards the person’s prior experience and the efforts of their lesser-known predecessors. Conventional wisdom also places great weight on insight in promoting breakthrough scientific achievements, as if ideas spontaneously pop into someone’s head – fully formed and functional.科学发现被普遍认为是博物学家查尔斯达尔文和理论物理学家阿尔伯特爱因斯坦等知识明星的纯粹天才的结果。我们对这种对科学的独特贡献的看法往往忽视了这个人以前的经验和他们鲜为人知的前辈的努力。传统智慧也非常重视促进突破性科学成就的洞察力，就好像想法自发地跳入某人的脑海 - 完全形成并发挥作用。 There may be some limited truth to this view. However, we believe that it largely misrepresents the real nature of scientific discovery, as well as that of creativity and innovation in many other realms of human endeavor.这种观点可能有一些有限的真实性。然而，我们认为它在很大程度上歪曲了科学发现的真实本质，以及人类努力的许多其他领域中的创造力和创新的本质。 Setting aside such greats as Darwin and Einstein – whose monumental contributions are duly celebrated – we suggest that innovation is more a process of trial and error, where two steps forward may sometimes come with one step back, as well as one or more steps to the right or left. This evolutionary view of human innovation undermines the notion of creative genius and recognizes the cumulative nature of scientific progress.抛开达尔文和爱因斯坦这样的伟人——他们的巨大贡献受到了应有的赞扬——我们认为创新更多的是一个反复试验的过程，向前两步有时可能会后退一步，以及迈出一步或更多步右或左。这种人类创新的进化论观点破坏了创造性天才的概念，并承认科学进步的累积性质。 Consider one unheralded scientist: John Nicholson, a mathematical physicist working in the 1910s who postulated the existence of ‘proto-elements’ in outer space. By combining different numbers of weights of these proto-elements’ atoms, Nicholson could recover the weights of all the elements in the then-known periodic table. These successes are all the more noteworthy given the fact that Nicholson was wrong about the presence of proto-elements: they do not actually exist. Yet, amid his often fanciful theories and wild speculations, Nicholson also proposed a novel theory about the structure of atoms. Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning father of modern atomic theory, jumped off from this interesting idea to conceive his now-famous model of the atom.想想一位名不见经传的科学家：John Nicholson，一位在 1910 年代工作的数学物理学家，他假设外层空间存在“原元素”。通过组合这些原始元素原子的不同重量数，尼科尔森可以恢复当时已知的元素周期表中所有元素的重量。考虑到尼科尔森对原元素存在的错误判断：它们实际上并不存在，这些成功就更加值得注意了。然而，在他经常提出的异想天开的理论和疯狂的猜测中，尼科尔森还提出了一种关于原子结构的新理论。诺贝尔奖得主、现代原子理论之父尼尔斯·玻尔 (Niels Bohr) 从这个有趣的想法出发，构想出了他现在著名的原子模型。 What are we to make of this story? One might simply conclude that science is a collective and cumulative enterprise. That may be true, but there may be a deeper insight to be gleaned. We propose that science is constantly evolving, much as species of animals do. In biological systems, organisms may display new characteristics that result from random genetic mutations. In the same way, random, arbitrary or accidental mutations of ideas may help pave the way for advances in science. If mutations prove beneficial, then the animal or the scientific theory will continue to thrive and perhaps reproduce.我们要如何看待这个故事？人们可能会简单地得出结论，科学是一项集体和累积的事业。这可能是正确的，但可能会收集到更深刻的见解。我们认为科学在不断发展，就像动物物种一样。在生物系统中，生物体可能会显示出由随机基因突变引起的新特征。同样，思想的随机、任意或意外突变可能有助于为科学进步铺平道路。如果突变被证明是有益的，那么动物或科学理论将继续蓬勃发展并可能重现。 Support for this evolutionary view of behavioral innovation comes from many domains. Consider one example of an influential innovation in US horseracing. The so-called ‘acey-deucy’ stirrup placement, in which the rider’s foot in his left stirrup is placed as much as 25 centimeters lower than the right, is believed to confer important speed advantages when turning on oval tracks. It was developed by a relatively unknown jockey named Jackie Westrope. Had Westrope conducted methodical investigations or examined extensive film records in a shrewd plan to outrun his rivals? Had he foreseen the speed advantage that would be conferred by riding acey-deucy? No. He suffered a leg injury, which left him unable to fully bend his left knee. His modification just happened to coincide with enhanced left-hand turning performance. This led to the rapid and widespread adoption of riding acey-deucy by many riders, a racing style which continues in today’s thoroughbred racing.许多领域都支持这种行为创新的进化观点。考虑美国赛马中一项有影响力的创新的例子。所谓的“acey-deucy”马镫放置，即骑手在左马镫上的脚比右马镫低 25 厘米，据信在椭圆形赛道上转弯时具有重要的速度优势。它是由一位名不见经传的骑师 Jackie Westrope 开发的。韦斯特罗普是否进行了有条不紊的调查或检查了大量的电影记录，以精明地计划超越他的竞争对手？他是否预见到了骑乘 acey-deucy 所带来的速度优势？不，他腿部受伤，左膝无法完全弯曲。他的修改恰好与增强的左转性能相吻合。 Plenty of other stories show that fresh advances can arise from error, misadventure, and also pure serendipity – a happy accident. For example, in the early 1970s, two employees of the company 3M each had a problem: Spencer Silver had a product – a glue which was only slightly sticky – and no use for it, while his colleague Art Fry was trying to figure out how to affix temporary bookmarks in his hymn book without damaging its pages. The solution to both these problems was the invention of the brilliantly simple yet phenomenally successful Post-It note. Such examples give lie to the claim that ingenious, designing minds are responsible for human creativity and invention. Far more banal and mechanical forces may be at work; forces that are fundamentally connected to the laws of science.许多其他故事表明，新的进步可能来自错误、不幸和纯粹的机缘巧合——一个快乐的意外。例如，在 1970 年代初期，3M 公司的两名员工各自遇到了一个问题：Spencer Silver 有一种产品——一种胶水，只是有点粘——但没有用，而他的同事 Art Fry 则试图弄清楚如何在他的赞美诗书中贴上临时书签而不损坏其页面。解决这两个问题的方法是发明极其简单但非常成功的便利贴。这些例子证明了这样一种说法，即巧妙的设计思维是人类创造力和发明的源泉。可能有更多平庸和机械的力量在起作用；与科学定律有根本联系的力量。 The notions of insight, creativity and genius are often invoked, but they remain vague and of doubtful scientific utility, especially when one considers the diverse and enduring contributions of individuals such as Plato, Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Galileo, Newton, Kepler, Curie, Pasteur and Edison. These notions merely label rather than explain the evolution of human innovations. We need another approach, and there is a promising candidate.洞察力、创造力和天才的概念经常被引用，但它们仍然含糊不清，科学实用性值得怀疑，尤其是当人们考虑柏拉图、达芬奇、莎士比亚、贝多芬、伽利略、牛顿、开普勒等人的多样和持久的贡献时、居里、巴斯德和爱迪生。这些概念只是标记而不是解释人类创新的演变。我们需要另一种方法，并且有一个有前途的候选者。 The Law of Effect was advanced by psychologist Edward Thorndike in 1898, some 40 years after Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking work on biological evolution, On the Origin of Species. This simple law holds that organisms tend to repeat successful behaviors and to refrain from performing unsuccessful ones. Just like Darwin’s Law of Natural Selection, the Law of Effect involves an entirely mechanical process of variation and selection, without any end objective in sight.效应定律由心理学家爱德华桑代克于 1898 年提出，距查尔斯达尔文发表其关于生物进化的开创性著作《物种起源》约 40 年。这个简单的定律认为，有机体倾向于重复成功的行为，并避免执行不成功的行为。就像达尔文的自然选择法则一样，效果法则涉及一个完全机械的变异和选择过程，看不到任何最终目标。 Of course, the origin of human innovation demands much further study. In particular, the provenance of the raw material on which the Law of Effect operates is not as clearly known as that of the genetic mutations on which the Law of Natural Selection operates. The generation of novel ideas and behaviors may not be entirely random, but constrained by prior successes and failures – of the current individual (such as Bohr) or of predecessors (such as Nicholson).当然，人类创新的起源需要进一步研究。特别是，效果法则所依据的原材料的来源并不像自然选择法则所依据的基因突变的来源那样清楚。新颖想法和行为的产生可能并非完全随机，而是受到当前个人（如玻尔）或前人（如尼科尔森）先前成功和失败的限制。 The time seems right for abandoning the naive notions of intelligent design and genius, and for scientifically exploring the true origins of creative behavior.现在似乎是时候放弃智能设计和天才的天真观念，科学地探索创造性行为的真正起源了。 "},{"title":"写个策略脚本","date":"2023-02-03T23:20:32.000Z","url":"/2023/02/03/Feb202303/","tags":[["复盘","/tags/%E5%A4%8D%E7%9B%98/"]],"categories":[["量化","/categories/%E9%87%8F%E5%8C%96/"]],"content":"我问 ChatGPT 如何开发一个 AI量化系统，它说 Developing an AI quant trading platform involves several steps: Define the problem: Determine what type of trading strategy the platform should employ and the assets it should trade.
